# DIT355 - Distributed Systems - Filter Repository



## **Description**
The filter component is one of four components of the DENS CURA system. It is responsible of the communication between the frontend and and the distributed components of the system. It filters out faulty requests made within the system and returns the correct format so that the user receives information the way it is intended. For a more detailed view of the DENS CURA system, please view the [Main repository](https://github.com/PatyMarklund/DIT355-Distributed-System-Main).
